TITLE:: FluidDataSetWr
summary:: Write to FluidDataSet on the server
categories:: Libraries>FluidCorpusManipulation
related:: Classes/FluidDataSet

DESCRIPTION::
A UGen that adds data points with associated identifiers to a link::Classes/FluidDataSet:: Internally, this calls code::setPoint::, so IDs that already exist will be overwritten, and new IDs will be added. The actual work is done on the server's command queue, rather than the real-thread.

By default the object takes a control input (code::idNumber::) as a numerical index that gets used for the point identifiers. This index is used to write each time the Ugen is re-triggered with a zero to non-zero transition. The identifier is then concatenated with the code::idPrefix:: symbol, which is fixed at instantiation. In this way, one can make custom, incrementing identifiers, e.g.

code::
FluidDataSetWr.kr(~somedataset,"my_data",PulseCount.kr(trig),~somebuffer,trig)
::

would add points like code::my_data0, mydata1, mydata2...:: if successively retriggered.

Alternatively, for one shot use you may not want a numerical suffix at all. Setting code::idNumber:: to code:: nil:: will bypass this and use only the code::idPrefix:: string.

CLASSMETHODS::

private:: *new1

METHOD:: kr
The equivalent of calling link::Classes/FluidDataSet#-setPoint::, but within a link::Classes/Synth::

ARGUMENT:: dataset
An instance of link::Classes/FluidDataSet::

ARGUMENT:: idPrefix
A string or symbol with a prefix for generated identifiers.

ARGUMENT:: idNumber
ANCHOR::offset::
An integer with the offset to start creating identifiers from. If the UGen is run in a server-side loop (i.e. repeatedly re-triggered), the generated identifiers will count upwards from this offset. If nil, then no numerical index will be applied to the generated identifier (i.e. only the idPrefix is used).

ARGUMENT:: buf
The link::Classes/Buffer:: containing the data point.

ARGUMENT:: trig

A kr trigger signal

ARGUMENT:: blocking

If 0 then the job will run in its own thread (not reccomended for this object)

EXAMPLES::

code::
s.reboot;

//make a dataset
~ds = FluidDataSet(s);

// write a single point, no counting
(
{
	var b = LocalBuf.newFrom([0,1,2,3]);
	FreeSelfWhenDone.kr(FluidDataSetWr.kr(~ds,"help_data_point", idNumber: nil, buf:b));
}.play(s);
)

//look
~ds.print;

//Write a 100 points quite fast with server-side triggering
(
~ds.clear;
OSCFunc({
	"FluidDataSetWr help: all points written".postln;
	~ds.print
},'/datasetwrdone').oneShot;

{
	arg n;
	var buf = LocalBuf(4);
	var trig = Impulse.kr(ControlRate.ir / 8); // can't go any faster
	var idx = Stepper.kr(trig,min:-1, max:n); //we need to start at -1 to catch the first increment

	FluidKrToBuf.kr((idx * 4) + [0,1,2,3],buf);
	FluidDataSetWr.kr(~ds,"point-",idNumber:idx,buf:buf,trig:trig);
	SendReply.kr(idx >= (n-1), '/datasetwrdone');
	FreeSelf.kr(idx >= (n-1));
}.play(args:[\n,100]);
)

strong::incremental buffer writing - sky is the limit::
code::


// start the entry maker, trigging twice a second
(
~ds.clear;
{
	var buf = LocalBuf(4);
	var trig = Impulse.kr(30);
	var count = PulseCount.kr(trig) - 1;
	FluidKrToBuf.kr(WhiteNoise.kr(1.dup(4)),buf);
	FluidDataSetWr.kr(~ds,"point-",idNumber: count, trig: trig, buf:buf);
}.play;
)

//print a few times
~ds.print;

//clear before flushing the writing synth and the process keeps on going
~ds.clear
~ds.print;

//command-period to stop it
~ds.print;
~ds.clear

::
strong::circular writing::
Each time link::Classes/FluidDataSetWr:: is triggered it is like the link::Classes/FluidDataSet#-setPoint:: method so if the identifier does not exist it creates it. If the identifier does it exist then it updates it with the new values.

By looping code::idNumber:: values, we can use a link::Classes/FluidDataSet:: similar to a "circle buffer", always have the most recent code::n:: points in it that we want.

code::

// always have only the most recent 10 points in the buffer
(
{
	var buf = LocalBuf.newFrom([0,1,2,3]);
	var noise = WhiteNoise.kr(1.dup(4)) + Sweep.kr(1,1);
	var trig = Impulse.kr(2);
	var count = Stepper.kr(trig, min: 0, max: 9, resetval: -1); //0 to 9, starting at -1 to catch the first entry
	FluidKrToBuf.kr(noise,buf);
	FluidDataSetWr.kr(~ds, "point-",idNumber: count, trig: trig, buf:buf);
}.play;
)

//print regularly to see a specific identifier being overwritten
~ds.print;
~ds.clear
